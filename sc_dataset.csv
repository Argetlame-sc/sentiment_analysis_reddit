Greetings,

We had reports of extreme packet loss and desync over the weekend. Reports were that packet loss could go well above 70% or full 100% for minutes at a time and is very noticeable when interacting with NPCs and fighting AI ships as they would appear to stall.

To look for packet loss, use ""r_displayinfo = 3"" in the console and on the top right look for the following:

""Net: ping XXms, msgRTT XXms, loss 100.0%""

If you start seeing packet loss, please record a video with that information displayed of what you are doing at the time of the loss. Post the video as a reply here and contribute to the following IC with any logs and additional information you have:

https://robertsspaceindustries.com/community/issue-council/star-citizen-alpha-3/STARC-122277-Unplayable_lag_and_desync

Thanks for helping us investigate!

1,"**Summary of the Throwing Mechanics**

The main issue the team found with the throwing mechanic was that the precision wasn't very accurate, and therefore players were not using the throwing mechanic very often. They wanted to make the mechanic more robust, clearer, and precise.

Throwing in 3.11 will feel quite different. The controls will be changed to allow the player more time to decide how to throw (instead of just the G key for equip and throw). G will now be used to select and equip your grenade, left mouse button will be for overarm throw, and right mouse button will be for underarm throw. A display will be added to show where your object will go to after you've thrown it. Also, objects will now have mass, so throwing will feel a lot more realistic (you won't be able to throw objects that weigh too heavy).

In the future, melee weapons might also be throwable. Every single prop that is released will now be using the same system, so all new content will automatically be supported. [Physicalized damage is also on the horizon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1y11wXmf24&feature=youtu.be&t=186), which will affect throwing and combat.

**Summary of the Sprint Report**

* Area 18 day/night time lighting improvements. ([3:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1y11wXmf24&t=232s))
* Concept art for space station EVA access hatches to support upcoming EVA missions. These EVA missions will involve players walking on the surface of these space stations, for investigation, repair, and combat missions. ([4:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1y11wXmf24&t=264s))
* The addition of new defensive turrets on space stations, to support the eventual removal of armistice zones in stations like Port Olisar. ([4:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1y11wXmf24&t=287s))

SC is betting SQ42 will do very well and raise a lot of money.  I have no doubt they can finish SC even without a boost from SQ42, however I do agree that it's disheartening to see so many gameplay loops pushed back year after year.

That said, if the investment in tech allows 60+ fps with engaging combat and gameplay, it will have been worth it.  If they cannot deliver on that, I don't SC doing very well.

1,">  Because from what I've seen no one can actually explain the importance or end goal of this half decade long AI behaviour.

I think that's more because you haven't been attention to the discussion and the things discussed by CIG. No, they won't suddenly have ""1000 other NPC archetypes up and ready for the PU"", but it will be *significantly* easier to develop those other NPC archetypes because the logic that dictates AI behaviour is agnostic. It's not that hard to understand - in the process of building the bartender, they developed the ability for the AI to take items from/give to PC and NPCs, search for items in the environment, stow game objects in their inventory, combine existing objects, and place objects into the game world. The FPS AI reloading behaviour talked about in the Monthly Report seems a lot like how they described the bartender searching for drinks to mix, except they just changed some parameters to make them look for ammo.

> weren't bartenders and all NPCS at some stage supposed to move around from their jobs, to leisure activities, to home and repeat their routines?

Only for the NPC AI on the Idris in SQ42. In the PU, they're going to be 'faked' to represent the unseen millions simulated through the Quantum system. As you run around, you'll have probability volumes for NPC encounters based on what's happening in the simulation, and Quantum will tell the game when to spawn in NPCs and what they're wearing/using/doing.",4607

> there's no evidence anywhere that gameplay loops are being worked on. 

Prison gameplay is scheduled for 3.9, and that is a gameplay loop whether you are interested in it or not. Player status mechanics is also a massive new gameplay system. Mining consumables are also going to mining much more active and make it relatively complete. You can't just pretend that major features of the next patch don't exist to push your narrative.

Furthermore, the majority of the remaining PU gameplay teams being moved to SQ42 to meet the 2020 beta deadline is a known fact that we were all annoyed about a few months ago. Get with the times - we're onto bitching about how 1 artist making 2 moons in a month is still too long even though this time last year it took a full team over a month to make a single moon.",8532
2,"> Explain how making the gameplay first and then ships later makes for more work

I just did.  If they waited for the gameplay before working on ships, then the time *before* the gameplay is ready is 'wasted'.  If it takes e.g. 6 months to implement Salvaging (which CIG estimate), but only e.g. 1 month to update the Reclaimer to use that salvaging functionality, then given how long it took to actually model the Reclaimer, it's more efficient - from an overall project perspective - to implement the Reclaimer first, then update it when they finally have Salvaging implemented.

You'll note that CIG does seem to be waiting for each Profession before implementing ships for it.  The Prospector (only miner so far) came with the first iteration of mining.  We have the Reclaimer, but no other salvaging ship (and Salvaging was due a lot earlier, so they may have been synchronised, before Salvaging got pushed back).  We have the Starfarer but no other refueling (and Refueling too was due earlier).  We have no Repair ships.

Exploration and Scanning / Scouting isn't likely to require changes to ships, and combat is functioning, so the only area where CIG have introduced significant number of ships first, before it's fully implemented (no support for external cargo) is Cargo / Hauling.

So if anything, that reinforces my point that CIG was right to start producing ships as early as they did - but equally they do appear to have tried to sequence the development order to avoid doing too many 'specialist'  ships before the relevant mechanics are implemented.",16685

0,"> Gameplay loops need to come first

No, they don't. The tech needs to be finished, and sooner it's matured enough the better. Then CIG can go nuts adding gameplay without having to rewrite loads of code every time a new tech milestone is reached. This means in the short term there's going to be less gameplay additions for us to play with but in the long term, the game will be released much sooner.

Having said that CIG are still putting a ton of work into flight and FPS mechanics, AI,  and mining and cargo should be in a more completed state within the next few patches. The game economy needs more fleshing out because that's what is going to ultimately drive gameplay loops. So, there's still a lot of gameplay work being done despite people claiming the contrary. It really annoys me when people just ignore the gameplay stuff that is being worked on because it's not whatever happens to be their pet favorite profession.

Those are all 3rd person games. In those games it doesn't matter much where the character is looking because you as the player are looking over their shoulder anyway. Here though, I assume you don't want to suddenly be looking somewhere else because you got knocked down.

Edit: Heroes and Generals added a rolling animation when you exit a vehicle at speed. They made it so that the camera follows the head during the roll, so you as the player are disoriented for a few seconds. They did that to discourage people bailing out at speed and it works so well people have complained they get nauseated by it and have petitioned for its removal.

> I don't know, I think the animations are probably the worst aspect of Star Citizen right now. It's a series of mo-capped animations with no natural connection between them and it looks extremely dated.

1,"> So what's the point of having this large, powerful ship if cheaper ships can shoot me and escape

I mean , like people keep saying the point (which I'm not sure I agree with but at least makes some sense) would be to make them STOP shooting at you and give them a big repair bill, at least. Fending off the attack. As opposed to being overwhelmed. 

Unfortunately we have been trained by this game and others that a ""win"" and therefore our gameplay reward, is when the enemy goes boom. I'm definitely interested whether it's possible to have engaging gameplay without that. I certainly don't want battle to involve death half the time.  That sounds shallow and not fun unless the game becomes a respawn fest.

I think if they ever FINALLY get to a point where there's a wide gap between disabled or crippled and ""explode"" (which should almost never actually happen) it'll be easier to see. Who knows what year that'll be though. And sq42 seems like it's still going to be a bit arcadey.",55347

1,">I think your suggestion that this first implementation of SOCS only impacts memory utilisation is incorrect.

Sean Tracy said as much during citizencon and also during a Star Citizen Live episodes several months ago.  That is what I am basing this assumption on.   Also not pathing NPCs that no one can see has already been part of a previous patch as far as I remember. Without SSOCS the NPCs should be in memory all the time, but they are not pathing without anyone around.  You can sometimes see a glimpse of them catching up when you approach one of the rest stop hangars slowly.

That said, I never said ***server*** cpu performance wouldn't be improved by SSOCS. In fact it is quite obviously doing that since the server seems to disagree a lot less with the clients about path prediction in 3.8, probably due to higher server update rates. There is significantly less jitter when you observe other players moving around now.

However,

>in general you're correct that SOCS likely won't show much of an impact on the client side.

This is the point I was trying to make. SSOCS increases server performance for sure. And it is definitely a big stepping stone towards server meshing, full persistence and a bigger verse.  What concerns me is that people expect large client-side performance and frame time gains in 3.8. SSOCS V1 will not address the client side performance issues people are experiencing.  If people are hyping themselves up for that, they are going to be disappointed with 3.8. The biggest performance problems are usually around the large landing zone to begin with and those problems will not get solved until the Vulkan conversion is complete.

So to clarify. What I was talking about is that SSOCS will increase server performance in certain ways, but it will not affect client-side frame-rates and frame-times significantly. Not yet anyway.

IMO its more likely that in-atmo operation become more dangerous and if you are damaged you will want to avoid planetary bodies and will opt for a space-station stop for repairs before entering atmo, especially on high-g bodies like Hurston, ArcCorp, or MicroTech.

It took 5-6 years for people to really trust each other and for the new processes to mutate and mature into a mescle that everyone was committed to. It was painful and there were a lot of casualties.

Instead they chose the strategy of putting up only 5 tasks on the Roadmap and progressively add 5 more tasks, and in the end 10 tasks get released. So in both scenarios, the same 10 tasks get released in the end, but the 2nd scenario generates praises while the 1st generates salt. That's a nice trick to fool players who fell for it.

They don't show us every Jira task for every entry, as it's way too many to mean much to us, instead it's the higher level steps.

Jiras have a hierarchical tree, they break down each task into its components, and group them into steps (take a look at the ship production pipeline for an example of all the tasks likely to exist on a per ship basis).

It can be possible that a Jira has passed from in progress, to complete, and then bounced back to in progress upon review and feedback. A lot of work is done, it's literally the final touches to that task, but to us it hasn't moved, to the dev team it's bounced back and forth once or twice this week with a lot of progress at the smaller steps.

Sometimes a Jira is blocked by another task, but once the blocker is resolved everything can slip into place. So what we also see is not a lot of movement on some tasks until the last month, when the harder ones fall into place and unlock the ability to finalise others.

He can sell you crap. You can talk to him. That interrupts his routine. He talks to you and return to his routine. He can be interrupted by multiple players too.

If they are interrupted by player they engage in combat. They disengage from combat when you leave. And they have to restock ammo. Pick up weapons etc.

Same thing if you hire engineer for your ship. Lets say component gets damaged. Engineer have to locate and pick up repair tool. Navigate the ship and run towards the damaged area. And perform a job.

**ALPHA 3.10 PATCH WATCH**

Below you‚Äôll find a quick update on the status of the Alpha 3.10 patch release, as well as a look at what issues we had to solve during the 3.10 PTU cycle.

**Current PTU Patch: Alpha 3.10.0t PTU.5771442 | Patch Notes**

**We‚Äôre currently very close to releasing Alpha 3.10 to the live servers, with our current target being this week. More specifically, we‚Äôve been battling two blockers that are being squashed right now.** Players have been reporting various gameplay delays, such as missions updating and rocks fracturing. We have been digging in and investigating, with a possible fix already incoming in the next build thanks to data provided by all of you. We have also been experiencing some frustrating issues related to impounding, but a quick fix has already been delivered.

With these potential fixes either checked in, or about to be checked in, we‚Äôll look to confirm the fixes were succesful and then publish to the live servers! Thanks so much to everyone who participated in early testing!

**Alpha 3.10 PTU Cycle**

Albeit long, we had an incredibly successful PTU cycle that allowed us to fix a myriad of issues, thanks to all of our testers‚Äô help.

We‚Äôd like to share some more of the specific bugs that have been fixed below. Please note that neither of the following lists are exhaustive. At the time of writing this, we‚Äôve fixed 282 individual issues and 142 instances that caused crashes during this PTU cycle.

**Bugs from Alpha 3.9 that have been fixed as of the latest PTU build:**

- Authorized Execution Warrant missions from Hurston should no longer award the player with a crimestat
- Fixed ADS positions on FPS weapons to be centered so that crosshairs line up to the bullets firing
- Weapon lockers on the 890 Jump, Constellations, Vanguard Sentinel, and Carrack should now persist weapons when the ship is stored and retrieved
- Hangar 02 in CRU-L4 rest stop should now be accessible via elevator
- Planetary weather effects should no longer clip through MFD‚Äôs in ship / vehicle cockpits
- Fixed missing areas of gravity on the surface of Delamar

**Notable issues fixed since initial PTU build:**

- Analog throttle stopped working
- Exploit allowing players to send masses of aUEC via the mo.Trader app
- Vanguard poor flight feeling
- 600i atmospheric flight difficulties
- Landing splines being missing in certain circumstances
- All ships exploding arriving or leaving out of Area18
- Lack of available resources for Greycat ROC
- Pitch ladder did not conform to the horizon
- Flares did not work as a countermeasure
- New Babbage elevators not functional
- Dot in the middle of the players screen in first person

As usual, your feedback is extremely valuable to us as we work towards exterminating remaining bugs, both on older and newer content.
If you come across an issue in-game, please consider contributing to the Issue Council, and if you have something to say about a new addition to the game, let us know by contributing to the official feedback threads on Spectrum.",46406

Or more simple, look at all the orange, the blue and even the brown/green in 3.4, EVEN the reliant / constellation taurus / 300 got moved. The only thing that didn't move is the armor and the hawk, mathematically that cannot be the majority. Now 3.3 was closer so only -all- the gameplay and AI got moved + cloud tech, that's probably closer to 60%, still majority.

Now you can tell yourself that everything is fine and we are on track, or that regardless of the road they took, the current state of the game is where you expected it to be.

2,"Hello again, everyone!

Coming at you with another update as we get closer to Alpha 3.11! Like we mentioned before, teams are putting the final touches on their work that you‚Äôll be able to see in the ‚Äòverse come patch day, and we're taking the opportunity to provide some additional insight into some of the upcoming improvements!

In tomorrow's Roadmap update, a card will be added detailing the relaxation of armistice restrictions. Beginning in Alpha 3.11, we are allowing ship combat in Armistice Zones around all rest stops. The caveat is that it‚Äôs ship combat only ‚Äì FPS weapons combat is still disabled inside or outside the station due to a limitation which should be rectified in a later release. Obviously, we couldn‚Äôt simply allow ship combat without also ensuring our stations were adequately protected and policed so there have been big developments in this area.

We wanted to give you a bit of a deeper look into the changes that will be made alongside the armistice relaxations, so we once again caught up with Luke Pressley (@PickledAtRandom) and the design team to break them all down for you:


- 1- Destructible defenses of a few sizes and varieties have been added on and around the rest stops. These range from the small S4 turrets (now destructible) placed on landing pads, through S6 sentries seen in the Claim Jumpers missions, to ALL new S10 turrets on and around the perimeter of the stations. Once destroyed, these currently respawn after 5 minutes (subject to balancing), but in future we aim improve this simplistic system.

- 2- We have created a Security Response system which while still quite simplistic, adds the CrimeStats of all players in the area (we‚Äôre calling this internally the ‚Äúheat‚Äù) and spawns security ships of increasing number and strength in response. The system responds quickly to increases in an area‚Äôs heat by spawning in new ships and despawning out any weaker ships they replace. The system responds slower to the killing of its own members (should the heat not be raised by this) and slower still to decreases in heat (to keep security patrolling for a time to ensure the threat doesn't return any time soon). We will develop this system further in the future to also take into account the type of ship the players are using.

- 3- A new infraction has been created called the Armistice Violation. This is a felony and is given should players damage other ships or station defenses within the Armistice Zone. It does have a grace period and allowance in which the player is warned that further infractions will result in a felony. For it the first implementation, this new infraction will only remain active on the player‚Äôs criminal record of 1 day.

- 4- Should the player enter the Armistice zone while having a CrimeStat or gain a CrimeStat whilst within the zone, they will be shown a warning telling them to leave immediately.

As usual we'll be monitoring your feedback closely as soon as soon as you get your hands on these changes, so be sure to let us know what you think! We understand this is a fundamental change and fully plan to iterate until we're in a good place.

We hope you enjoyed this update! Like we mentioned before, we don't have a set schedule for these types of updates but we'll be continuing to follow up with other teams in the coming weeks to see what additional 3.11 fixes and improvements we're able and ready to share early with y'all. Stay tuned!",36138

2,"Hey, thank you for such a great response! I honestly didn't get it before, but now I think I understand. I really didn't have anything against the concept, I just didn't really grok how people could be so excited about a ship when they wouldn't be able to use it properly (yet) lol. 

Though I was pretty disappointed with how many issues I had, I actually enjoyed my free-flight so much that I am considering asking my Wife to get me a package for Christmas. The game was buggy as hell (assuming hell is buggy) and could be quite frustrating at times (it took me a half dozen tries just to get to Lorville successfully) but those things aside I still enjoyed it quite a bit, and that is saying something for sure!

Edit: Oh, and thank you for being so civil. Another reason this game looks to be so promising is being a part of such a cool community. :) ",25762

2,"How can you cat there's no content expected this year when we all we have is a roadmap that only covers the first half of the year?

I'm guessing the reason why we haven't seen the latter half is because there are some big things being worked on but rather post it on the public roadmap prematurely like in the past, they probably want to get to a point where they know it can be finished in the allotted time. 

Also in many eyes this is not a barren roadmap, sure there's no major features but it's completely overhauling the flight system which was in dire need, this first two quarters so far seem to be stability and backend focused which we can all agree on was much needed, as what's the point in giving us new stuff if what we already have is broken or out of wack. 

We've also been going through a worldwide epidemic. I don't care what anyone says when you have all 500 employees working separatly from each other in their own homes, relying on their own internet, data caps, home life, kids, etc it's going to be less efficient than working in a studio. Wheres at work if you have a question, need approval, need assets from another team, it's a short walk. At home it could be hours before you reach the person you need. It's also not only CIG this pandemic has affected, look at cyberpunk or basically any other larger team project, they all have seen delays and reduced content.

I'm for one am grateful for what we have been getting. We also don't know what's going on behind closed doors. I was a little upset about the Invictus event, that they spent all that time working on an event that will only last a week. Now it's coming out that the stations that the caps docked at were actually the refinery stations that we will be getting in the future, the flight patterns of the caps were a testing for AI flight, and that 99% of that event was just a public testbed for features currently being worked on with just a Invictus tarp thrown over it to keep some things a surprise. We know pyro is nearing 50% significant work is being made on other unknown systems, salvaging, refining, and possibly data running are being worked on, and trading is getting a major overhaul that we will see shortly. I think cig has learned that being 100% only bites them in the ass and we can thank ourselves for them not being completely transparent. It can be hard to put a date on new features being developed and any time they were wrong we would jump down their throats. And that's probably why no other company ever did what. CIG does when it comes to transparency but like I said that's our fault as a community and I think we should not expect much less transparency as a result and we should just let them do their work, enjoy what we have, and look forward to whatever future surprises have in store.",3650

1,"How much money someone else has should not affect you. I understand what you're saying about undercutting, but being undercut does not mean you can no longer trade. That was something I dealt with in MMOs for years and it didn't stop me or anyone else from trying.

Your example only really works for a day 1 scenario. For example, if Player A starts out with a starter ship and works their way up to a Caterpillar, and Player B starts playing after Player A got their Cat, the same situation occurs without any extra money outside of the base package.

And again, Player B could always rent a larger ship for pretty cheap, or they could be hired by Player A and they could both make money off the prices Player A can get from undercutting the competition.

What I'm trying to point out here is the difference with SC is you're not limited to what's on your account. You could even go as far as playing this game without ever owning a ship.

I currently have one ship to my name; a Cutlass Red. I upgraded to it to help out with org events because it's a great spawn point. But I don't feel limited as far as ships go because I know so many other people with ships that it's never been an issue. I've even gone as far as captaining a fully crewed Carrack a few times. If I need a combat ship there are plenty of people willing to spawn one for me. I've been a pilot for someone's second Carrack and he paid me a portion of the cargo I hauled for him.

That means you lose a foot of altitude for every foot forward. Or to put it another way, you fall at a 45 degree angle in a stable glide. 

Most fighters are designed around the high thrust they have, and take advantage of that with more instability for better turning performance. This also means they don't generate much lift. They intentionally have as little lift as they can get away with, because they are not designed for efficiency, they are designed for high speed. The more lift surface you have, the harder it is to go fast.

On top of that, fighters are HEAVY, very dense airplanes.

There‚Äôs really no other way to do space combat other than making large fuel limitations. But then it‚Äôs jousting and tightening/widening orbits every 6 hours in orbit around a planet. 

With the capabilities the spacecraft have, and with Newtonian physics, there isn‚Äôt all that much that can be done. A solution to this is weaponry that can fire at 40 kilometers a second. And for ships travel at 5 kilometers a second. This will allow orbits around planets as spaceships zoom past polar polar caps of plants and swing around orbiting moons to engage watch other. It will feel more strategic. 

But at that point the ships won‚Äôt be visible. 

It‚Äôs hard to create a visceral combat experience (seeing enemy ships fall part less than 500 meters away) while also retaining 6dof Newtonian physics.

If someone can fly around and grief people, but then just run away whenever things get too hot, and to try to keep up the Hunter is suffering accuracy penalties, it becomes rather arbitrary.

Similarly, it becomes impossible to pirate anything with any amount of speed on it, since once again the pirating ship is worse for moving fast.",55353

Instead of down voting me, maybe you guys should not upvote incorrect information, and  I am sorry but the infamous funding spreadsheet is just wrong whether you like it or not.

Most of the stuff in that list seems pretty vital compared to other things.

1,"I think they must have meant Beta, not release -- because to release in Q2 the game would likely already have to be in Beta.

This isn't going to be an alpha this time, which means the engine, UI, AI, everything needs to be in a state to go gold.  If you remember this took a year longer than they thought on both 3.0 and 2.6, and those were both Alpha releases.

There is no way CIG is going from say, Beta in Q1, to to going fully gold in Q2, with translations/localization done, VR, etc..  It just doesn't make sense.",2105

1. We are really missing a good space game/story in the market of this quality. Its going to be really nice to have it honestly.

1,"I think we took the nosedive in late 2016/early 2017, then again in early 2018, when they decided to change direction on a bunch of stuff and not really tell us.

I think 2019 (and maybe last half of 2018) has maybe been the first year where they've actually had a valid and truthful roadmap and progress.  First half of 2018 they were still overly optimistic, but then changed direction and got more realistic (which to us looked like slowing down).

I don't know what's happening the last couple months, but I don't think out of all the years that THIS is the one where they took a serious nosedive.  I think it's just the one where it's finally the most obvious and the layers of hype have eroded off.

In a way I finally feel like they're being the most honest; the problem is that we finally have to see how slow progress is and just how freaking far behind they actually are; which we weren't really seeing before.",18153

1,"I work in the software industry as developer and QA specialist for fairly big company. I have even worked on AAA games. That's why I know that CIG just hand us the internal roadmaps they are working with because we - including myself - would not understand what we are seeing. They have to refine that information, add necessary context to it (context that we otherwise wouldn't have because we are not inside the daily decision making processes at CIG), and of course also decide what they can tell to the public.

I also know that Chris is not lying because I have been on the other side of the fence. I know and understand what it means when developers say that they hope to hit a milestone in the third quarter, why they will in nine out of ten cases not reach that milestone on time, why developers have to shift things around and prioritize one task over another.

Also, we are not stakeholders! CIG doesn't have to answer to us. Yes, they have made a promise and they are constantly striving towards fulfilling that promise (you might not agree with everything they do to get there, but they are trying), but they could cut us out completely and we couldn't do anything about it. Considering how immature and impertinent many people here are behaving I'm actually a bit surprised that CIG is still talking to us.",38136

A perk of having reputation with the Nine Tails might be that Nine Tails pirates won't try to shoot you on sight. Or maybe a perk you get for your bounty hunter reputation might be you get a head start on accepting certain bounty contracts before they hit the net and are open to everybody.

I wonder, though. New Vegas has faction reputation, but even if you were to max that reputation out, the game would keep treating you as a freelancer. So I secretly hope that if you max out your reputation with the Nine Tails and sink your reputation with law enforcement, they'll start calling you a Nine Tails rather than just an associate of them.",40050
1,"I'd like a small ship to win, like the Titan or such.

CIG will put effort into creating something special for the winners, and this should be something that is available for as many backers as possible, not just the ones who spammed the ""buy 890J"" button at the right time.

It would also serve as a way to make the small ship more unique in the mass of other ones. Take two cars of the same model. They still differ by a lot. Yet in the future there is only one look for most ships?

Even smaller games (Duke Nukem Forever, 13-15years) can take a long time. Star Citizen's scope grew a ton, along with Squadron 42. Keep in mind they are working on two projects at once and trying to share assets between the two. Even if they share similar features, those features might require some special attention specific to each project. While I look at the chart above, the development process looks behind schedule but it doesn't tell the entire story.

You're right about the question of not being able to produce a complete design but this is a question of degrees not kind. CIG seem to have been all over the shop for years and don't really know still what their game has to be.

Sure, the current game isn't as polished as a released game should be - but then again, neither are many released games these days (just look at e.g. Anthem).  It also doesn't have most of its intended gameplay - but what it does pretty well with what it does have, and there's enough fun to be had to keep people playing.

Given CR has said many times that he intended to keep releasing updates post release, and wants to keep supporting it for 10 years after release, then 'release' becomes comparatively meaningless.

That's not to say that it shouldn't be 'released', only that worrying about it doesn't make sense.  Provided CIG keep patching at a regular interval, and keep improving stability and performance etc, at some point it will reach 'released' quality regardless of whether it has the 'release' label.

For many people that point likely comes once Full Persistence, Server Meshing, and Jump Points are implemented (along with the pre-requisites such as Server Side OCS).  With those features - and the lack of wipes with every patch - we'll actually have a game with progression, and people can start playing it 'properly' without worrying about wipes.... at which point, it's no different to playing e.g. an Elder Scrolls game on release (which have a strong reputation for bugs etc, and needing multiple post-release patches), except that people will have been able to play before that point, and have a good idea of what the gameplay is actually like, and the stability, etc.",22825

> Hello everyone,  
  
>  
>As part of the ongoing [Alien Week](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/17622-Alien-Week-2950) celebrations, we are excited to reveal an upcoming buff to the Aopoa Khartu-al.  
  
>  
>The Khartu-al, as the light attack craft of the Xi‚Äôan military, was always intended to be a highly maneuverable ship. As such, it forgoes a traditional main thruster for an array of maneuvering thrusters on articulated rigs.The flight changes coming in Alpha 3.10 (we‚Äôll publish a comm-link with more information tomorrow) led to a few modifications for the ship.  
  
>  
>**Ship Handling**  
We've applied unique handling characteristics to the Khartu-al that are especially apparent when flying in-atmosphere. The pitch behavior has been almost doubled and now utilizes the alien ship design to re-balance the rotations in all directions. While normal ships tend to have a drastically different ‚Äúpitch acceleration‚Äù vs. ‚Äúroll‚Äù vs. ‚Äúyaw‚Äù, we've balanced the Khartu-al to excel in all three.  
  
>  
>**Defense**  
We identified some weaker areas of the ship that resulted in parts breaking off more easily, which crippled the handling. The hitpoints for the four joint pieces holding the ship's wings have now been buffed. The default shield was originally a stealth-type component that didn't allow a lot of damage to be absorbed before shield faces were compromised. This has been changed to a higher-grade industrial item to improve resistance.  
  
>  
>**Offense**  
Weapons-wise, the Khartu-al was at a disadvantage for a large ""light"" ship which, in conjunction with the above-mentioned issues, meant it would receive more damage than it was able to handle and return effectively. To compensate for this, the hardpoint size has been increased from S3 to S4, and the default loadout changed to a gimballed S3 item. This allows players to make use of gimbal and auto-gimbal modes to increase hit chance and, for those who want to, swap to fixed S4s.

Its more of a problem when you get new employees on board. We used to estimate 3 months before people would be able to function somewhat normally without much supervision and 6 months before they could be considered competent in the position.

But this is a problem every company faces and there are other games out there with big code bases, and yet somehow they don't keep pushing back release dates for years.

> And if you have so many releases as CIG has, it usually means that some things get rushed which can lead to suboptimal code that has to be refactored later on.

The games industry is notorious for doing crunch. This is a problem of the company's mangement though, not the devs or the code.

Again, every company has the potential for this issue. They can not do crunch, go slower, do more testing, and have better results.

> The general rule is that the first 80% of a project take 20% of the time and the remaining 20% take 80% of the time. It's pretty universal and applies to all large development projects.

Indeed, this is a well known maxim.

Now think about how that applies to SC! We are 8 years in, the company has been in development full swing for at least 6 of those years. And yet we are still in alpha. In that case we are still in the first 80% with 20% of the time... if this maxim holds true, we will all be long dead before the game even releases!",16238

They then broke that task into three to come out over the next few update cycles.  They also didn't really have the ability for the AI to use QT, but that's finished for the 3.9 branch already.

I'd imagine we'll soon see AI moving between physics grids (read: onto and off of ships) along with ship looting and some other mechanics like that which are blockers on the road to a dynamic economy in 4.0 as well as 4.1 to further their goal of releasing that system to us this year, probably in 4.0 or 4.1, failing that  4.2 in Q1 of 2021.

In the part you mention, he clearly talks about pre-production: *""On travaillait notamment sur diff√©rents concepts, √©tablir la direction que nous voulions prendre, tous les √©l√©ments qui nous ont permis de d√©marrer le d√©veloppement.""*

I have said myself that early pre-production with concept drawings started in summer 2012, so what are you ranting about?! Haha!

All those games did/will take **less** time to develop than SC/SQ42 eventually will, which is the **opposite of what you have claimed** (*""Cyberpunk 2077 and RDR2 were in development at least as long*"")!

* Squadron 42: >10 years (probably at least 12 years)

* Star Citizen: >>1x years (less than 1% content done after 10 years)

* Cyberpunk: 8 years

* Red Dead Redemption 2: 8 years",6503

Actually nah, that's not your fault. I am a terrible producer of my own content.

So the interesting take away from this recent rant of CR's is the admission that SC did not yet have 1 million unique customers/players. Only that they're projected to have that at the end of the year (Dec 20th if by financial fillings). This is interesting because looking at the total accounts now, we're coming up on 35% of accounts being unique paying customers instead of Turbulent's ratio of 2:1 back in July 2016. That means it's taken another 4 years to make up 300k customers after the initial 4 years of 700k customers.

There's also the mention of AGILE again, so is staggered development out again?

Like I said, the problem wasn't CIG getting the estimates wrong - it was CR not owning up as soon as they realised the mistake.  As soon as I realised I had boobed, I told my manager, and we spoke to the customer...  and it was an uncomfortable discussion, but at least they knew what was going on, and what the revamped timelines were - and though the grumbled about it for the rest of the project, they didn't heap too much shit on us during the delay...

The benefits of agile are that it is extremely flexible, you have the power to shuffle things around and make the best product you can in the shortest amount of time you can as the situation changes around you.

With something more linear (like old school sw development, which I also have experienced first hand) when one cog in the machine fails the entire engine risks being ground to a halt. This means one delay cascades into many others.

With agile, a delay in one feature has minimal impact on others. If one component is delayed slightly, the teams with downstream dependencies can shift focus for a couple of weeks and not loose a ton of time. And because so many things are happening in parallel, shifting focus, or ‚Äúre-prioritizing‚Äù as CIG likes to put it lately, is really not that big of a deal. It‚Äôs maximum time-efficiency.

Not all creations would be approved of course, but this could really help get them a head start on several areas of the game.

Very cool episode",39801
1,"The feature progress actually looks quite good and on track, the same can't be said for the chapters progress, even considering that they're working on them in parallel

The roadmap starts in Q2 2018, we can't see how much it took to complete the 9 whitebox narrative phases in Q2, and the same goes for 7 of the 13 phases completed in Q3 2018, they may have spent 2/3/4/... quarters on them. As for the other 6 phases in Q3, they were completed in 1 quarter. Still, we don't know much about what happened back then, how many phases were delayed and all that as the SQ42 roadmap was published in December

Q4 was the first quarter we had access to the SQ42 roadmap. They planned to complete 8 phases in Q4 but they ended up completing 3. In Q1 2019 they planned to complete like 20 phases (+ the 5 delayed in Q4) but they ended up completing 10. They planned for 24 of the 28 chapters to be whitebox complete at the end of Q1 but instead as of today they just completed the whitebox of 11 chapters, the narrative for 13 chapters and 4 chapters are not even ""narrative-complete""

So they basically completed 8 narrative phases and 5 whitebox phases in 6 months (8 if we consider that we're in June, but I'll wait for the end of Q2 because we can't see the progress on the single phases, so they may even complete 10 phases or whatever in the next couple of weeks). Now they plan to complete 15-20 whitebox/greybox/production phases every 3 months. Compare what they're planning to do and what they actually did in the last months and you'll notice a quite big discrepancy

This is why I decided to make my own personal roadmap based on the current pace of the chapters' progress. I may be right, I may be wrong, I can't force anybody to believe me, but that's what I honestly think. If they eventually speed up the whole process and they're able to have SQ42 in beta by Q2 2020 I'll be very happy, but otherwise I won't be disappointed as much if they delay it, as I'm already expecting it. I expect them to finish the chapters in Q2 2021 based on their current pace

What you do instead - you develop gameplay prototypes and plan your systems for much further than you would have on release. A good MMO releases with years worth of grow space.

Frontier's problems are just their (technological) inexperience in the field of running a constantly updated/ongoing game. The idea they had was pretty sound, they just messed up its execution.

> SC took the opposite approach to Elite, once the funding proved itself stable enough to depend on.

Not exactly, it seems pretty much the same. It's just they start a new iteration before they finish previous one and before they have a release. But look at their development - they also have same amount of assumptions made early on they have to remove, they are still doing assumptions based on whatever stub functionality they have now, etc. There is no far-ahead design. There are some castles in the clouds design dreams, but no solid ground design that would dictate what they would need and when.

It's very clear from regular roadmap storms and what not. So, basically SC goes through exactly the same story as E:D, but without ""release"", which doesn't help much as it's still race against a clock and when they would finally do the release, they would end up in exactly same situation as E:D.

However, as Chad (I think) said, work on LTP at the end of last year / start of this year delayed iCache.  If they were intending the Salvage work to dovetail with iCache, then Salvage had to be pushed back due to the delays on iCache.

As for why they didn't just move the Salvage ticket, instead of removing it - it was around that time that Covid was making itself felt, meaning that it was hard to know what the impact would be or what the potential delays were... so better to just remove it rather than see it start constantly sliding, etc.",37985

1,"There are a lot of games that have long travel times. Classic MMOs like EverQuest, FFXI, and even WoW had long travel times. They were all considered successful and are still played to this day. 

But this discussion is about spline jumps which are near instantaneous, and whether or not they should spit you out above atmo or in atmo.

There are plenty of games already that appeal to appeal to a wider audience. This game does not have to appeal to a wider audience in order to be considered successful. No game does. That's why there are also games that appeal to niche audiences, like the MMOs I listed above, WoW being the closest to appeal to a general audience. Like I mentioned before, we would have a ton of simple, samey games if every game designer had to placate to the general gaming populous. When they tried it with WoW they started losing subscribers. Eventually eventually they realized that there was a big enough market to release WoW Classic; with long travel times, time sinks, and all.

Besides, I don't really think it's a good idea to invoke the general gaming populous as a way to judge something like Star Citizen, considering how they feel about it right now.

Travel times aren't the only time sink in SC, and more are already in the works.  If the issue is that you don't want to dedicate several hours to play the game, either you need to play smarter, (like sticking around a planetary area and planning out your long distance travelling), or maybe schedule out some time so you play for a few hours.

I can think of three deterrence off the top of my head:

1) Co-pay system or premium system - For example, I claim my P4-AR rifle. I have to co-pay 30%. So let's that's 1000 aUEC out of my pocket if I want a replacement. Also, you could pay a higher monthly premium if you've made a lot of claims lately. If you haven't made a lot of claims, the insurance company may reward you with lower Co-pay or lower monthly premium. Sort of like a reputation system.

2) Long delivery time - Takes a long time to get my stuff back, and I may actually have to fly to landing zone (where the insurance company is located) to get it back as opposed to magical delivery to my Hab.

3) Insurance fraud detection/penalty - Just like IRL where insurance company can be pretty nasty about accepting your claims, in SC they could do the same - and that could be built in as part the long-wait time. Also, the more frequently you make your claims, the longer the wait time becomes for your next claim. It could become so bad that it takes like a month to get your rifle back. Of course, I doubt CIG would have the insurance company outright reject your claims as that would probably create controversy, but the bigger your claims, the more 'penalty' is applied to the wait time. Sort of like a prison sentence kind of scheme.

My guess... this mechanic will have to be reiterated over many many many patches - just like the whole crimestat thing - which despite several years of implementation it's still far from optimal.",52500

Its not their fault that you only follow at the development at a level of scrutiny that leaves you with tons of questions on whats going on. They are making incredibly clear and fantastic gains each patch, especially given that CIG is working on two games with somewhat different requirements at the same time (which, btw, I think was a mistake, they should have done one then the other but hindsight is 20/20).

The problem is as a ""general consumer"" you've have developed a completely incorrect sense of how fast this kind of thing should move because most games are announced <2 years from release or are small indie games which are much much easier to iterate on quickly compared to this. And to be clear, the scope of SC is *completely unprecedented*. Even if you had reasonably intuition on development time on this from say, AAA games, it would still be unreasonable to assume it applies directly to a project with the scope of SC. 

Also, something a lot of new people here seem to not realize is CIG asked the community back in ~2013 or so ""Should we push to release in 2014, or try to use all this money to create the ""full vision"" and the community voted for the latter. So its kinda fucking bullshit that now the community is like ""wait, no, we didnt want this"" when really they do because the game that *could* have been made in 2014-2015 was a shallow puddle compared to what they are developing. It would have come out. Got 7/10 reviews and faded in obscurity by now.

If it takes them another year to get SQ42 out to the public? That's 9 years, which is a significant amount of time, but it's not world ending. Final Fantasy XV took 10 years, Team Fortress 2 took 9 years of development and both of those were working with well established publishers with large teams in established organizations.  


Going from 12 people to around 500, building a ""world class"" studio and going from basically a ""mom and pop"" sized corporation to a large corporate structure, while building, arguably, the most ambitious MMO project to date?

If it's the former it displays such a mind-boggling willful ignorance of history that it's incredibly saddening. At no point in human history has the idea of ""oh hey why don't we just fix racism by treating everyone the same!"" actually worked. Period. The idea that ""racism will start to fade out"" is pants-on-head-stupid, has never been shown to be what actually occurs, and much more insidiously, implies that the African American community should just wait for things to get better after literal centuries of racism. Bullshit - that's not how progress gets made, and the only advocates for such a path or those who don't want to see it made because they aren't willing to fight for it.

The attempts to strawman this into a 'well it's just because the media made it about race' displays such a profound failure to grasp the underlying reasons behind this movement, and deliberately disregards the veritable mountains of evidence that support it, in an attempt to not look at the bigger picture and sweep of history and directly enables and tacitly supports continued systemic racism, by fixating on a perceived flaw you think you can tilt out in this one particular case which, conveniently, ignores having to look at any of the others.

And that last line...ooooh boy.

>If just means we don't like messages like this much because we fear they only cause more indirect pain in the long run.

The exact same sentiments were expressed by people during the Civil Rights movement who might not have been out trying to lynch people, but nevertheless pointed to that happening as a reason why all those angry people should just stay and home and be content with their lot in life, for fear of making things worse in the long run.

In short- your preached ethos of 'race-blindness' are precisely what have enabled racism for generations, because to try to argue that it's not about 'race' is precisely what allows so many to ignore the facts, which support the idea that it very much is. It's been a subtle shift from being directly responsible for the problem to just being willing to turn a blind eye because you likely internally agree but don't want to take that stance yourself.

In particular, updating the interior geometry of the OLD model of the Avenger Titan while the Avenger rework was nearing completion and releasing with the next update.  Fixing something that, as far as I could tell wasn't broken to any extent that would cause a need for the work to be done.  Or maybe it helped performance for  a month.  It just to me seemed like a waste of effort to update an already end of life-cycle asset.

tl;dr: You weren't entirely wrong to read my criticism in that tone.

It's just, I'd love to hear the real reasons these decisions are being made is all.  Or to be more precise, I just want to know why reworking these particular things at these times is more important than the other possible work those same team members could be doing.  Implementing things that aren't in the game at all yet.

The medpen is probably a bad example, since it does look like they're implementing body dragging in fairly close timing with the medpen rework, and it could be simply adding the functionality to apply a pen to a friend.  Which technically is adding functionality more than re-working existing functionality.  If that's the case, that's definitely appreciated work.",23989

CIG have said in the past that 'open PVP' will not be consequence-free in the UEE, in the same way that e.g. the US Gov does not permit individuals and private companies to wage war / kill each other - consensual or otherwise.

Thus, if you want to have a PVP fight, then it either needs to be in a 'lawless' system (unowned, pirate, or other), or you have to disable the monitoring...  

So what CIG have implemented is closer to the long-term goal for the game than it was previously - the only thing missing is the unregulated system(s) where you can fight without having to disable the big-brother sats first.

As for the pirate / BH discussion - the 'pirate' agreed to that scenario when they committed the crime - it is the consequence of the crime.  Yes, currently it's biased in favour of the BH... previously it was (marginally) biased in favour of the pirate.  In the future the bias will change again, and again, and again.  This is the nature of playing a game that is in the middle of development.

Out of the 37 items planned just 90 days 2 have been finished and 4 are still needing to be finished. The discrepancy from the 3 finished I stated earlier is the finished item (Human AI Combat V2) was added after the start of the patch (July 5^th ) if we include it then 7 items still in, of which three are finished, from 38. If not other item gets pushed then 18% of planned items **since the start of the quarter** are done. If they pushed all unfinished items at the end of quarter as they have done in the past then just 8% would be done.

It‚Äôs not the best AI I‚Äôve ever seen by any means, which I consider fair for a company that‚Äôs never made a shooter, but it‚Äôs a quantum leap from last year. 

The reason people keep saying it‚Äôs the servers is because the AI is heavily dependent on the server for instructions. The problem is that CryEngine prioritizes instructions made by players, so AI tasks never get executed and they freeze up. If CIG can fix that, which is really what the networking rework is all about, the AI still won‚Äôt be the best but it will execute its task queue without freezing which in combination with the cover usage coming in 3.10 would drastically improve the situation.",4340

client will be the server as well. Therefore, we will execute the same
code as we do on the Star Citizen server. In fact, we do that already
internally. And as Squadron 42 and Star Citizen share the same code
base, fixes for Server-Object-Container-Streaming for either product
will benefit the other.",14131

1,"Wow what's with the downvotes? I'm just saying that if a game has damage mechanics, it has health bars - and that there's really no other great way to do it in an efficient manner even if it is abstracted to sub-components.

Couple that with people saying that the ships feel like they are flying health bars - which is, well, mostly true - and that the armor, component-damage, pipes should help alleviate that feeling by abstracting it across multiple 'health bars' with different modifiers and effects.

 I think that's going to help separate that time-to-kill from the time-to-disable clock, which is something that I think would satisfy the players who are into combat and want reasonable 'kill' times vs. the players who aren't keen on actually dying so fast.  

In fact, couple the short time-to-disable with a long time-to-kill along with that new 'surrender' mechanic and that should allow players to 'surrender' to AI gangs and pay up a ransom if they are disabled to the point where they can't fight anymore. Pay the ransom and the pirates will leave you alone to limp home. Then you have to weight the pros and cons of starting a fight, betting you can finish it or run away, or even just paying the ransom if you think it'll save you money (compared to being blown up or the repair bill)",53001

Highly recommend the Star Citizen Leak stream where they showcase the stuff that the teams actually work on and it gives you a far better idea and communication on why things are taking so long. Without that I would never know that:

Hull-C is basically complete. 

Bengal is really far along.

Javelin is almost complete.

CIG is moving away from selling concept ships and more into physical ships.

Ground War is being actively worked on and the map looks pretty good.

Tons of Vanduul ships are completed but can't be shown because they are set up for SQ42 cutscenes and would cause spoilers. 

Plethora of other animations are being done etc. Especially for enemy AI. 

All that stuff I saw on there is a lot more comforting then the main roadmap.

Also I know it's a running gag that the game is taking forever but realistically they basically restarted the whole process when they realized how much money they got. If you compare current SC to what it was it looks and it is a different game.

>you'd still think it wasn't progress because your goal metric subjective to your unattainable goalpost of released two years ago.

Words in my mouth. They said they could attain everything by 2014. Then when they realized that was unattainable, they pushed it one year. When they realized that was still unattainable, they pushed it one year. When they realized that, too, was unattainable, they delayed the release date until they could figure out when it was done. Trust me, I believe Star Citizen is a technical marvel with the developers trying to tackle issues most game developers ignore. But while that is admirable and impressive, it is so at the direct expense of their ability to ship the game.

Of course, as long as all the backers are okay with the constant delays and feature creep, then my words fall on deaf ears.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. Their progress has improved. But you can not deny that they are **far** behind **their** original, revised, and revised timelines for release.

I think the largest issue I have with your posts is that you‚Äôre saying the progress is ‚Äúinsane‚Äù or ‚Äúamazing.‚Äù To me, their progress is good to great, but does not fall far enough off the bell curve as to be exceptional.

Players in a remote location on Hurston don't have to be causally connected to a dogfight in orbit. By separating the local simulations, a possible server crash in one local simulation won't affect other ""islands"". They are still in the same universe though and the simulation can still propagate seamlessly between the ""islands"" if necessary (for example when the players in orbit bombard the players who are on the surface).

he didn't do that, particularly not that early on before the decision was made to fully crowdfund the whole project and go balls to the walls with it. 

His critique of the industry at the time was that They didn't want to make a Modern Space game in the same vein as Wing Commander with today's tech as they thought space games didn't make money and there would be no interest. His snark regarding that was largely about the idea of Proving them wrong.

and well at about $250 million for a game that isn't even out yet, and every new Backer seems to prove him right.

1,"The private Free Flight mode in Arena Commander **is your friend**, use it get to accustomed to controlling your ship(s); as well as testing any customization to your control scheme.  *At minimum,* I would recommend you practice until you can confidently avoid obstacles at high speed (relative to whatever ship you are flying), and can also land and take off completely manually.  Yet any number of hours you spend in there should pay off a hundred-fold when you are either in the Persistent Universe or any other mode of Arena Commander.  Similarly even if you have no great interest in racing, trying some private races can still teach you quite a bit about what you are capable (and just as importantly *not* capable) of in any particular ship.

After that you might want to try either the Pirate Swarm or Vanduul Swarm modes.  They both pit you against waves of increasing more difficult NPC flown craft, either with NPC wingmen or in cooperation with other players.  This not only introduces you to ship combat, but (potentially) fighting as part of a small group.

In the same vein, you might want to try Star Marine to practice FPS or personal combat.  However you might want to hold-off until you become acquainted with some of your fellow players.  As many backers tend to think of personal combat in general and Star Marine specifically as secondary to the ship-oriented gameplay, it can at times be difficult to find a match.

Finally **you will encounter bugs,** even on the Live PU Servers.  So get used to it, and if you want to do something constructive, submit bug reports and/or contribute to existing reports via the [Issue Council](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/community/issue-council)

Also at this point in development, **things will change!**  Most of the game mechanics and underlying systems are either only partially implemented or still waiting to be implemented.

I'd dump that Verse Pack (ugh..one of the worst). Do you happen to have a $0 CCU from Crucible/Endeavor/HullD to the Carrack or Reclaimer? If so, that Gemini is basically worth $400 in the CCU system if CIG makes a Gemini -> Crucible/Endeavor/HullD CCU available in November. If that's the case, I'd grind that guy into a Carrack and never look back. The remaining $565 (assuming $240 Gemini) could become a lesser package (keep it small due to shit insurance...Alpha/Titan style), another of the $350/$400 profession-pinnacle ships, and something like a Cutlass or Freelancer so you have a decent multi-role starter.

Actually there's hints already. When datamining 3.2 I found a ton of info about a historical tour/hunt across Crusader's moons with tons of locations. Both P.I. Wanted and ICC Assistance leave open ended questions about the state of the Stanton system. P.I. Wanted leaves the question of why \*SPOILERS\* Mel Ososky's group wanted to take out Covalex Hub Gundo. We know she was working for someone else called Red Sand. The final ICC Assistance mission with the Starfarer wrecks points to corporate foul play by Avivar in Stanton. And most significantly, there's a series of clues pointing to a JP to Vanduul space in Stanton. There's a reason why Tessa, as a member of the ICC looking for Jump Points on the fringe of known space (Stanton is on the ""upper"" fringe), managed to send the player to a location where you're ambushed by a Scythe, a LONG way away from the Vanduul front.

A player provided a viable, repeatable solution. And CIG took it because it just works.

They have to have this alpha where all players of the same patch can play, assuming there is no issues with the patch.

It's one thing to push back release dates by a year or two, many games have, but we are talking FIVE years after the initial promise.

To me this heavily implies that they're further loosening up the restrictions of armistice zones, as they started doing recently by allowing unarmed combat in parts of Grim Hex. But your rights to fire weapons in an armistice zone may be revoked if you hurt innocent people.

I agree, thrusters look like shit in all circumstances, and it shows the most when hovering in atmo. I want to see powerful blasts coming out of them, and some kind of visual instability in atmo.

1,"The planets already spin.   Everything in space around them spins with them.     If they made it so everything in space didn't spin with them, then from the ground, the space station would be going around the planet (at the same rate as the sun and stars) and it would be like adding really sucky orbital dynamics.

The scale looks right, is necessary for playability, and actually isn't far off. Most of the sizes of the planetary bodies we are on are at least big enough to collapse under their own gravity.  There is no FTL travel in the game. Quantum travel is a fraction of C. Without fan-winking artificial gravity, all the ships would have to either be circular and spinning or use their engines for gravity like the ones in the expanse (which would be cool but a totally different game). 

Oddly low geosynchronous orbits will not look right.  They will look like massive buildings hanging magically above the ground with nothing holding them up.  It will look cool for ignorant people who don't know [space is like this](https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/) and drive people who know shit about space up the @#$@ing wall, pretty much like watching Armageddon.

If you ask me, with the current state of the game, you can do more with the Cat since it enables you to accumulate wealth quicker than a Mole. From there, the money earned will allow you to branch out by renting or buying ships in-game to test out and have fun with. On top of all that, it's easier solo if you dont have partners.

I also encountered the random death at the landing zone that you did. This was after landing my Freelancer MAX upside down because my thrusters stopped working and I had to kill my power to drop into the landing bay I wasn't quite centered over, clipping the side and tumbling me.

0,"I'll go through them in detail now:  


**Radar and scanning** in my opinion need a lot of extra work, at the moment, it is one of the subsytems in the ship which lack complexity in a more glaring way.   
There are some things of it that I like, for example I like the fact that radars and scanning in SC can be done in a 360¬∫ way, but it already is taking a bit of the complexity of using real life radars away as these only scan small areas and then move around the scan to locate things, where you operate how and where they move to get the best out of them.  
I would like to the very least the radars to be able to detec in a less binary way, at the moment you either find enemies or not, and the emissions and cloaking systems don't seem to work at all. This I'd love to see changed soon.  
The information that the radar shows as well is very limited and hard to read fast in a combat, we can't distinguish ships at all on it, their direction, speed, relative speed... we need to be able to know more so that radars are meaningful, and ways to operate that let skill be a factor.  


Scanning also is very binary, showing the weird looking boxes as the only hint as to what they have discovered, be it a ship, a mineable, a friggin space station... I would really love the scanning to change into something where all the way till the ship can identify what it is scanning, showing some data or something that might let you be able to do educated guesses as to what you are finding. Be it through analyzing the emissions you get, the shape of the return, intensity, distance, speed, direction... some of this should also apply to radars.   


(additional comments regarding radar/scanning mechanics in the missile section)

**Missiles** at the moment are in a place I really dislike, where they feel pretty much like ignoring physics and being very inconsistent, as well as not having skill rewarding mechanics on them as they are just lock and fire in approach. Despite having different guiding systems, these often seem to have little to no effect, as well as the countermeasures to them.  
But they also behave in really weird ways once flying with very inaccurate behaviours to what a real missile would do.   
In general, I'd like them to gain an initial speed with a big booster engine that would soon run out, leaving the missile relying on either aerodynamic forces through fins or such to control it's direction or through thrusters for the attitude but that can't make it accelerate anymore. At the moment, it is very hard to defeat missiles by maneouvring because they keep the ability to accelerate all the way to max speed for their whole flight untill they disappear or explode after finding a target, so you'd need to constantly dodge them till they give up which is very unlikely or accelerate to your max speed and hope they never catch up, which is the current most used method of missile avoidance. I don't like this approach and feel like they should have much higher top speeds than ships, but as I said before only being able to boost for a small while and not for the entirity of their flight, or leaving that as a special kind of missile which in exchange has less damage power or something similar.   
Related to missiles, I would like the radar / scanning system to include what in real life is called RWS (Radar Warning System) that's intended to give pilots awareness about radar threats. In star citizen it could be used also for detecting missiles launches, when people lock you, their relative direction from you, and it would be a tool to be used in order to dodge or defeat missiles already launched against you. (thought about adding in the radar section but made more sense here in a way)   
I too feel like we need more locking methods for the missiles. I'd like them to have the options to be guided from the ship instead of their own onboard guideance systems, so the enemy doesn't get the RWS signal from the missile and it's harder to evade. This would also let friendly forces paint a target for you to shoot without a lock, helping to increase cooperation among players and adding variety.   
I'd like to see something we lost from the older days of Arena Commander, the ability to lock missiles into multiple targets and fire them all at once or one by one.   
And finally I'd like missiles to be rebalanced once all these changes are made, because their hit rate would probably decrease by quite a bit and at the moment they are mainly balanced for something that's intended to hit most of the time. 

&#x200B;

**Damage system** in the current build and the ones before is one the things that let's me down the most of combat, as explained previously all it takes is being hit in one of the areas of your ship with a small health pool to blow up all together which is something I really don't enjoy, taking away a lot of the readability of the engagements.   
Currently I also don't like how some of the areas with their own health pools can be relatively weak, for example the front wings of the Cutlass, and how taking them down early with luck can make a huge difference. I'd like this kind of ""X"" damage makes the part blow away go off and replaced with something more system that requires you to damage the structure enough to just lose a part instead. And I really want the part where you blow up because ""X"" part of your ship took ""Y"" amount of damage.   
I know there is a much more system damage model in the works that takes penetration, armor and components into consideration and while I know of it being worked on the background since I don't know what it includes I'll still add this part.  


  


**Ease of operation of the subsystems**  while in fight is one of the things that always makes me mad, for example, in Arena Commander I have to use the interaction mode scrolling through some pages of MFD and then through components to overclock them each time I spawn, and there isn't a way to bind controls for my joystick or controller to those actions to make it more friendly. While there are some with the keyboard, those who don't use it to fly will find themselves struggling, and even those, will have to give up ship control for a brief period of time to do so. Ideally, you'd want such critical components to be reachable and easily accesible to either pilots or copilot - other crew members.   
Allowing for keybindings for such actions AS WELL as a good support for different methods of input to those is essential to a game like Star Citizen and we need some work on this area for combat. 

&#x200B;

**Finally, on fight repair systems** is the kind of thing that you could expect based on current technology or redundancy of components for being able to sustain damage in fight without that meaning that you get taken out of it. This could be for example automated cooling pipes repairs as a simple example, all the way up to robots that are able to EVA out of your ship or move inside it to find the damage and fix it.  
Why do I also think it would be good for gameplay? I believe giving limited repair capabilities in the field for military frontline ships helps create a dynamic where you are both able to have a second chance and also gives dynamics such as those who play as pirates to not just sit down once they disabled a ship and take their time to finish the job.

They feel really heavy - they feel like an actual vessel. At the moment I believe this is a bit too simple in Star Citizen and for the bigger ships tasks should be more spread out between multiple players (atleast to utilize the ship optimally).

I imagine it being something like this:

- The captain sets target orders for the other crewmen: Waypoints based on both position and orientation, designating targets for the gunners, shield facing instructions for that seat action, they can set up triage orders to the engineer for repairs if they are required. This is all systematised and HUD-based. While VOIP can be useful, the captain will probably want the clarity and brevity of sending out official orders to the crew in a battle situation.
- These orders are sent to the HUDs of the respective crewmen who carry out those orders as efficiently as possible. Perhaps with some of this information being shared to other crewmen, such as the gunners knowing where the helmsman is supposed to orientate the ship to next. They can ignore these orders, focusing on other targets or moving to a different position, repairing something that seems more pressing or protecting another part of the ship. Whether this counts as taking initiative or insubordination is the captain's call.

The cool thing about this is that it puts the captain's position as director of the ship front and center instead of giving them the nebulous task of barking orders at people over local comms. But it gives the crewmen plenty of latitude to toe the line or to ignore their orders entirely.

Heh, that'd be pretty subjective I guess. From a personal standpoint I've always enjoyed the campaigns in the the various Croberts games over the years. Even *if* the storyline was a bit cliche sometimes, the execution was good enough that it kept me entertained.

Besides, these days it's hard to create something sci-fi without hitting at least a *few* narrative cliches.

> Interesting thing is. CR's games never had very long dialogues like in Witcher 3 for example. I wonder if that's a case anymore. I don't really like long conversations in video games I sometimes skip some useless bits in Witcher. I know a guy who can't even finish that game only because of dialogues. 

I always felt Wing Commander / Starlancer had tons of dialogue - not as *comprehensive* as games like The Witcher, but still very dialogue-driven experiences. From my perspective my fondest memories of some of the various missions in those games involved all the goofy wingmen chatter during combat, or panicked dialogue during tense moments.

It's a part of what I love about those games.  Then again, as a personal preference I consider plot and dialogue to be absolutely *essential* to any story driven experience and I don't think I've ever skipped dialogue in any game I've ever played (unless I died and I'm forced to replay a section or something). I'll gladly soak up any bit of lore and character development a given game might have - I can't speak for the preferences of others, but I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing how the dialogue turns out in SQ42.",1855816

In Eve, when a ship blows up, it's totally destroyed. Some modules survive and the insurance is pretty underwhelming on anything t2+.  In star citizen, your ship blows up and you get a brand new one with stock loadouts.

In Eve, major power blocs of groups of alliances and corporations clash over vast areas of space and resources. CCP (the game's company) has largely fucked this over with asset safety and citadels. Star citizen seems to be going the route of NPC corporations and governments.  I hope that we see the players get more control as the game becomes more efficient to handle massive battles. Especially over lawless space.

In Eve, local tells you everyone that is in a system, except wormholes (praise Bob).  I hope in star citizen that no active list will exist. Space should be expansive, mysterious, and dangerous.

Lastly, in Eve you are a captain of a ship, giving orders that the crew carry out. You can be a CEO and manage other players.  You can be a spy, leaking Intel or wait for an opportune moment to steal it all.

Most of what they do is trying to streamline the creation processes and procedural systems to the point where generating unique high quality content is both as fast and efficient as possible, and you cannot obtain that without defining the exact scope of what that entails.  
  
From what i gather of previous ATV memories, they started all this by building a system for snapping together outpost parts then moved on with procedural ""decoration"" based on context (type of planet etc...) and then moved on the the interiors etc etc...  
  
They're now trying to streamline all that so art teams will eventually be able to change/add what they need to with a minimal amount of work/disruption to the game.  
  
They also visibly spent most of their time working on NPC's combat/idling side more than general interactions, and probably dedicated most of that work to SQ42 while the PU brings different needs and challenges they now have to deal with.  
  
I guess the endgame there too is about being able to generate NPCs on the fly by cobbling together a model, a couple animations and a voice and then move on the the conversation/behavior tree without worrying too much about them falling through their chair or bumping in a wall.

The minor positive boost you get from being so open and communicative with the community is erased by regular shit storms. 

There's a reason why games like SC generally announce themselves, don't give concrete dates and all of a sudden show up in alpha and progress rapidly into beta and release.

Hmm.  1m^3 cargo space equals 1m x 1m x 1m.  If you add 125mm (0.125m) on each side each dimension becomes 1.25m. 1.25 x 1.25 x 1.25 = 1.95 m^3.  If the protection is only on the sides and the bottom/lid are essentially 0 that is still 1.25 x 1.25 x 1 = 1.56 m^3

To have 1 SCU = 1.25 m^3 the wall thicknesses would have to be < ~~75mm~~ 40mm  per side.  
(edit: even my math was borked initially.  1.08^3 = 1.26.  Which is 80mm per dimension or 40mm per wall padding)

Their numbers went awry somewhere. Maybe it is 125 mm total padding per dimension, meaning ~62mm per side?  That gets you 1.125 x 1.125 x 1.125 = 1.42 m^3",230472

1,"What even is the precise difference between beta and an ""mvp release"" in this content?

If both beta and release both only need include *most* core mechanics, is the difference between beta and release only the ""suitability"" of SC for a wider audience? Wider than what? The playerbase we have now, i.e. all backers? Does this mean just ironing out bugs and balance during a beta phase of testing?

This kind of thinking makes me feel like they're aiming for 5-10 systems by beta, some beta testing to confirm suitability for a wider audience, then wider release with *no necessary increase of system count*.",255438

0,"Is it just me or did that episode feel really kind of rushed? I think part of it was simply how fast each person was talking and the fact that it cut away almost the second they finished speaking.

Can't tell if it shorter to avoid wasting dev time or because the new format has to be useful exciting info at all times so if there's something irrelevant mentioned it gets cut. Maybe they just want to give more devs a little screen time each week so each individual dev can't ramble as much. Idk, but that episode felt super quick. ",323757

0,"why?  How well do you think you know the executives at CIG?  Do you have any other multi-national corporation who you give unwavering faith to?

Your explanation is very implausible, and at minimum displays a gross amount of incompetence all on it's own.  When an effective manager gives an aggressive schedule they maybe bump it up a couple weeks or a month depending on a number of factors.  [They know that if they make the schedule *too* aggressive that they are only going to demoralize their team.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/project-schedule-must-aggressive-achievable-ramiz-aliev-pmp-msc)  In this instance, Chris a) overshot by at least 9 months and likely an entire year, b) demoralized his staff and c) demoralized his consumer base all at once.  He should have at least had the foresight to realize giving the same aggressive schedule to the backers as his devs is a risky proposition.  If this was his plan then it reflects quite poorly on Chris as a manager.   So I'm back to option 1 or option 2 as the most likely reason, and probably a mix of the two.",1665987

I am very unhappy with how things are going, and my prediction last spring that 3.0 would not be out until near Christmas instead of the spring when announced seems to be accurate. 

The guy in the vid is not some DS troll. He was a major league backer who spent thousands and did not like what was being done and said by CR and CIG. There are many points brought up that cannot be explained away by using ""muh Alpha state"".

This whole early PTU release during the sale seems like a huge cash grab for unsuspecting people who will buy sunscriptions and be let into a PTU that is not even stable. The Evocati were ages away from a stable release yet CIG went ahead and dumped an update that was not ready for apparently a quich cash grab",1564830

1,"Nah - neither of those are relevant (presuming you're talking about rendering performance).  Interior geometry is completely irrelevant for rendering, because the GPU *knows* what it can - and can't - see, and only renders what is relevant.

The network / Server doesn't have that luxury for physics and entity updates, so you end up having to run updates for entities that you can't currently see, but which you *could* potentially see in the near future (if e.g. you turn around in 5ms time, or you open the Bengal hangar door, etc) - you have to be processing all those objects in advance so that you have the up-to-date object *ready* to render if required.",64416

1,"I assume that the restricted QT is necessary for the servers. By selecting a destination you are telling the servers and your client what they have to load next for you. With freeform QT the game could only guess what it has to preload to for you. 

I agree though that QT needs some significant improvements. For example you should be able to plot a course across several waypoints - including waypoints that you have set - and your ship should just slow down (but not leave QT) when it approaches a waypoint, automatically align with the next waypoint and accelerate again. We should be able to adjust the QT speed to manage waste heat, fuel consumption, probably sensor readings and so on. And it should be possible to just change your destination mid flight (maybe with some limitations, e.g. the new destination has to be in a somewhere ahead of you if you don't want to drop out of quantum).",1064687
