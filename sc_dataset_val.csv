0,"This is illustrative of so many of the underlying foundational problems going on I can't tell if it's written sincerely or as satire.

If it's the former it displays such a mind-boggling willful ignorance of history that it's incredibly saddening. At no point in human history has the idea of ""oh hey why don't we just fix racism by treating everyone the same!"" actually worked. Period. The idea that ""racism will start to fade out"" is pants-on-head-stupid, has never been shown to be what actually occurs, and much more insidiously, implies that the African American community should just wait for things to get better after literal centuries of racism. Bullshit - that's not how progress gets made, and the only advocates for such a path or those who don't want to see it made because they aren't willing to fight for it.

The attempts to strawman this into a 'well it's just because the media made it about race' displays such a profound failure to grasp the underlying reasons behind this movement, and deliberately disregards the veritable mountains of evidence that support it, in an attempt to not look at the bigger picture and sweep of history and directly enables and tacitly supports continued systemic racism, by fixating on a perceived flaw you think you can tilt out in this one particular case which, conveniently, ignores having to look at any of the others.

And that last line...ooooh boy.

>If just means we don't like messages like this much because we fear they only cause more indirect pain in the long run.

The exact same sentiments were expressed by people during the Civil Rights movement who might not have been out trying to lynch people, but nevertheless pointed to that happening as a reason why all those angry people should just stay and home and be content with their lot in life, for fear of making things worse in the long run.

In short- your preached ethos of 'race-blindness' are precisely what have enabled racism for generations, because to try to argue that it's not about 'race' is precisely what allows so many to ignore the facts, which support the idea that it very much is. It's been a subtle shift from being directly responsible for the problem to just being willing to turn a blind eye because you likely internally agree but don't want to take that stance yourself. 

So I really, truly do hope it's satire.",58698

0,"> Gameplay loops need to come first

No, they don't. The tech needs to be finished, and sooner it's matured enough the better. Then CIG can go nuts adding gameplay without having to rewrite loads of code every time a new tech milestone is reached. This means in the short term there's going to be less gameplay additions for us to play with but in the long term, the game will be released much sooner.

Having said that CIG are still putting a ton of work into flight and FPS mechanics, AI,  and mining and cargo should be in a more completed state within the next few patches. The game economy needs more fleshing out because that's what is going to ultimately drive gameplay loops. So, there's still a lot of gameplay work being done despite people claiming the contrary. It really annoys me when people just ignore the gameplay stuff that is being worked on because it's not whatever happens to be their pet favorite profession.

1,"We know the AI is decent because when playing on an empty server, missions that involve enemy ground forces like the 890 mission have the AI behave exactly how I would expect it to behave in a shooter. They do react to sound and light, and they do move around the ship shadowing you. It’s not the best AI I’ve ever seen by any means, which I consider fair for a company that’s never made a shooter, but it’s a quantum leap from last year. 

The reason people keep saying it’s the servers is because the AI is heavily dependent on the server for instructions. The problem is that CryEngine prioritizes instructions made by players, so AI tasks never get executed and they freeze up. If CIG can fix that, which is really what the networking rework is all about, the AI still won’t be the best but it will execute its task queue without freezing which in combination with the cover usage coming in 3.10 would drastically improve the situation.",4340

In Eve, when a ship blows up, it's totally destroyed. Some modules survive and the insurance is pretty underwhelming on anything t2+.  In star citizen, your ship blows up and you get a brand new one with stock loadouts.

In Eve, major power blocs of groups of alliances and corporations clash over vast areas of space and resources. CCP (the game's company) has largely fucked this over with asset safety and citadels. Star citizen seems to be going the route of NPC corporations and governments.  I hope that we see the players get more control as the game becomes more efficient to handle massive battles.

1,"The 'nailed in the sky' issue is because the IFCS is 'too good' at calculating and generating counter-thrust, etc (plus our overpowered thrusters).

CIG have talked about adding 'noise' to the thruster output, to generate slight movement - but they don't want to do it until after they're confident they've got the bugs out of the code - because artificial noise would mask erroneous outputs, etc.

Bear in mind that we *don't* fly our ships - the IFCS does.  All we do is give directions / inputs to the IFCS so it knows what we want.  At the moment, the IFCS is a bit too mechanical / artificial - which combined with everything else results in the 'bland' movement, etc.

2,"Tell that to every agile-based company ever (I.e. just about every major software company right now) :P

The benefits of agile are that it is extremely flexible, you have the power to shuffle things around and make the best product you can in the shortest amount of time you can as the situation changes around you.

With something more linear (like old school sw development, which I also have experienced first hand) when one cog in the machine fails the entire engine risks being ground to a halt. This means one delay cascades into many others.

With agile, a delay in one feature has minimal impact on others. If one component is delayed slightly, the teams with downstream dependencies can shift focus for a couple of weeks and not loose a ton of time. And because so many things are happening in parallel, shifting focus, or “re-prioritizing” as CIG likes to put it lately, is really not that big of a deal. It’s maximum time-efficiency.

I’m more than willing to criticize CIG when they mismanage their engineers, but honestly this is just the nature of modern software development. As someone who has worked in both environments, this is much better for us backers than the alternative.",13320

1,"> Do you think people who can't stand ""cliché"" to like it? Because I'm noticing a lot of people hating on movies if they notice something even slightly unbelievable.

Heh, that'd be pretty subjective I guess. From a personal standpoint I've always enjoyed the campaigns in the the various Croberts games over the years. Even *if* the storyline was a bit cliche sometimes, the execution was good enough that it kept me entertained.

Besides, these days it's hard to create something sci-fi without hitting at least a *few* narrative cliches.

> Interesting thing is. CR's games never had very long dialogues like in Witcher 3 for example. I wonder if that's a case anymore. I don't really like long conversations in video games I sometimes skip some useless bits in Witcher. I know a guy who can't even finish that game only because of dialogues. 

I always felt Wing Commander / Starlancer had tons of dialogue - not as *comprehensive* as games like The Witcher, but still very dialogue-driven experiences. From my perspective my fondest memories of some of the various missions in those games involved all the goofy wingmen chatter during combat, or panicked dialogue during tense moments.

It's a part of what I love about those games.  Then again, as a personal preference I consider plot and dialogue to be absolutely *essential* to any story driven experience and I don't think I've ever skipped dialogue in any game I've ever played (unless I died and I'm forced to replay a section or something). I'll gladly soak up any bit of lore and character development a given game might have - I can't speak for the preferences of others, but I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing how the dialogue turns out in SQ42.",1855816

Couple that with people saying that the ships feel like they are flying health bars - which is, well, mostly true - and that the armor, component-damage, pipes should help alleviate that feeling by abstracting it across multiple 'health bars' with different modifiers and effects.

 I think that's going to help separate that time-to-kill from the time-to-disable clock, which is something that I think would satisfy the players who are into combat and want reasonable 'kill' times vs. the players who aren't keen on actually dying so fast.  

In fact, couple the short time-to-disable with a long time-to-kill along with that new 'surrender' mechanic and that should allow players to 'surrender' to AI gangs and pay up a ransom if they are disabled to the point where they can't fight anymore. Pay the ransom and the pirates will leave you alone to limp home.

So the interesting take away from this recent rant of CR's is the admission that SC did not yet have 1 million unique customers/players. Only that they're projected to have that at the end of the year (Dec 20th if by financial fillings). This is interesting because looking at the total accounts now, we're coming up on 35% of accounts being unique paying customers instead of Turbulent's ratio of 2:1 back in July 2016. That means it's taken another 4 years to make up 300k customers after the initial 4 years of 700k customers.

What do you mean? Professions, as you say, will take ages, aren't they mechanics?

I'd be hopeful by sq42 combat, both space and ground, will be nailed on and that will be huge.",21652

1,"It would also add even more tech debt, without feedback of optimization of different machines later down the rod (if they ever get to optimization which I doubt).

It would be one of those things they'd release on later in theory, but people shying away from buying current or new consoles is not the type CIG wants to continue funding this game lol

Not to mention pathos of Stadia is in direct conflict of CR's vision of SC; to create a game worthy of true gaming machines. A vega 56 while decent isn't the strongest piece of hardware. You'd be looking  at downscaling.. something which ruins the whole ""fidelity"" thing we've been pumped for years now. 

That being said, I wouldn't doubt they announced support for it just to say fuck it why not here's another potential revenue stream. 

If they did it'd probably be a boost Stadia needs imo and just chasing new tech in general is fun to witness.",3194

The whole physics need work. Your ship doesnt even stand still on a planet, ships in ships is buggy as hell, people fall through planets, abruptly die in any sort of situation or simply float a drift in space from one moment to the next.

Believe me if I say this isnt a simple 'fix some geometry/boxes'

If they can't tackle this issue structurally this whole game will be a joke.

I can see it happen where they are unable to, and then suppose they could say how diverse the verse is and 'anything can happen'.

I dont hear any of them (devs) on these critical issues.

2,"Thanks!  I tend to back the camera up and adjust my focal length to zoom in, and I would say most of my shots in general have a relatively low FOV.  Messing around with f4+Home/ f4 + scrolling with the mouse wheel was a game changer for needing to zoom out while still keeping depth of field at the right depth.  Settings I just run very high, many of these screen shots were taken with 15-30 fps too so not to luxurious there.  If you're feeling ritzy you can also use ReShade for ingame realtime editing or adjust in software like photoshop afterwards.",595788

For SQ42 I guess the case is, that there won't be a real public alpha phase, and there will only be the short 6 month alpha hinted at, which doesn't mean the game isn't currently in alpha. As the game is horizontally developed among all chapters in parallel, it will be mostly content complete at that time as well.",40152

So when list of what they're apparently doing is essentially nothing, and there's nothing actually getting updated with the game. It's hard to see that anything productive is actually happening. It's not like this is new, or only recent. This has been their behavior for years. Why would it change anytime soon? I love this game, I backed it in 2013 and I'm still glad I did.

In 4 months we fucking recut a whole cinema movie, implement new vfx, sfx, reshot some scenes and deliver earlier than you are able to write this half baked excuses? You fucked up, thats that.

0,"It should be quite obvious that in almost 10 years (CR said development started in 2011) they have barely shifted the player count beyond 50 and this is supposed to an MMO. CR and his brother have quite casually in the past discussed thousand player battles and titanic capital ship duels with hundereds of players just crewing one ship.

An experienced developer would have thrashed out the netcode and engine fairly early on and built on top of that according to what was possible. CIG otoh have basically build a big dungeon using CryEngine, filled it with art assets, and are now trying to figure out how to turn that into an MMO.

You're right about the question of not being able to produce a complete design but this is a question of degrees not kind. CIG seem to have been all over the shop for years and don't really know still what their game has to be. Like I said, they made outlandish promises, build a big dungeon using CryEngine to showcase art assets to sell spaceships, and are still trying to figure out what to do with that dungeon and the assets in it. There isn't much more going on than that rather squalid and haphazard strategy.",42851
